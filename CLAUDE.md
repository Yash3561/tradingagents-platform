# TradingAgents Platform — Session Checkpoint

> Rally race co-driver notes. Read this before touching anything.
> Last updated: 2026-07-17 evening (CRITICAL session, full outage post-mortem: scheduled scans silently dead since 7/15. THREE stacked root causes, all fixed+deployed: (1) Render env Alpaca keys were the ygc2 account's PRE-RESET pair — 401 on /v2/clock read as "market closed" every tick; keys rotated everywhere by user, plus scheduler clock-error now falls back to local ET hours instead of standing down; (2) scheduler fragility — 5-min scan windows, no timeouts, dedupe flag burned before the scan ran; now 15s timeouts, wide catch-up windows (9:35–11:30 / 13:00–15:00 ET), Redis once-per-day guard released on failure, heartbeats; (3) Yahoo rate-limited Render's shared egress IP — every yfinance call 429'd, scans starved even when they fired. NEW `core/market_data.py`: Alpaca-first bars/snapshot, NASDAQ-first earnings surprises (calendar rows cached per-process = timing memory; past dates lose the pre/post field, yfinance timestamp rescue), yfinance = fallback only; fundamentals isolated so Yahoo failure degrades instead of blocking. Earnings blackout breaker exempted for engine=earnings-pead (was vetoing every PEAD order). Earnings arm LIVE on seemplyai@gmail.com: whole-market pool (150 reporters, ≥$2B), 25 candidates/scan (zero-LLM cap; agents keeps 10), 10% sizing (bound raised to 25 for a future dedicated aggression arm — do NOT raise the clean arm). Scan watchdog GitHub Action (no secrets) + nightly encrypted pg_dump workflow (needs NEON_DATABASE_URL + BACKUP_PASSPHRASE secrets). Missed UNH +29.8% and TSM +11.4% entries 7/16 to the outage. Precision backtest at exact live sizing: docs/research/earnings-live-config-precision-2026-07-17.json — holdout +15.4%, ~$835/mo mean on $100k, NEGATIVE median month (few big months carry the year — do not panic-kill flat months). Next live test: Monday 2026-07-20 09:35 ET.)

## What This Is

A **multi-tenant paper-trading SaaS** — a professional-grade multi-agent trading platform where each user signs up, connects their own Alpaca **paper** account, and the AI agents analyze + trade in *their* account.

**Not a toy.** Architecture is production-grade: typed agent contracts, WebSocket streaming, per-user Alpaca integration, market regime detection, Kelly Criterion position sizing, ATR-based stops.

**Paper-only, enforced server-side.** `broker_connections.base_url` is forced to
the paper API in code (`PAPER_BASE_URL` in `db/models/broker_connection.py`).
Live trading is a deliberate future product/legal decision — do not soften this.

## Current State & The Working Loop (★ orient here first — keep this section current)

**Live in production**: Vercel (frontend) + Render free (backend, `RUN_ALL_WORKERS=true`) + Neon + Upstash. Invite-gated signup. Admin = ygc2@njit.edu. Security-hardened (see Security Hardening) with 30-min JWTs + rotating refresh tokens, enforced CSP, per-user LLM quotas.

**Four strategy engines** selectable per user via `strategy_mode` setting:
- `agents` — the 7-agent LLM debate pipeline (`structured_runner.py`)
- `quant` — deterministic regime-filtered rules, zero LLM cost (`quant_baseline.py`). The control group: if agents can't beat it, the product story is explainability, not alpha.
- `intraday` — 5-minute-bar rule engine (`workers/intraday_engine.py`), zero LLM. Runs its own RTH loop (10s poll / 5m signal scan, started in main.py lifespan), imports signal code from `research/intraday.py` (no live/backtest drift), gtc brackets + time exit + 15:55 ET force-flat + daily loss halt (settings `intraday_*`, all NUMERIC_BOUNDS-clamped). Scheduled daily scans SKIP intraday-mode users (scanner returns `skipped_intraday_mode`). Only touches positions it opened (reasoning_json.engine="intraday-rules") — safe on accounts that also hold swing positions. AgentRun rows tagged llm_model="intraday-rules".
- `earnings` — post-earnings-announcement-drift (PEAD), zero LLM (`agents/earnings_pead.py`, shipped 2026-07-16). Event-driven, not high-frequency — rides the normal scheduled scan (market open + midday) rather than a dedicated loop; scanner.py pre-filters the watchlist to tickers with an actual fresh qualifying earnings surprise before running the pipeline (`_run_earnings_prescreen`). Enters long the first session after the surprise, gtc bracket (3.5×ATR stop, 3:1 R:R), plus a `hold_days` time exit enforced by `position_monitor.py`'s existing polling loop (reads `Trade.reasoning_json.hold_days`/`.engine` — `_place_order_if_approved` in `structured_runner.py` now copies those two tags from the AgentRun's reasoning_json onto the Trade row for every engine, not just this one). Settings `earnings_*`, all NUMERIC_BOUNDS-clamped. AgentRun rows tagged llm_model="earnings-pead". **LIVE since 2026-07-17 on seemplyai@gmail.com** (Alpaca PA3B9BRV3UWC — the former intraday account, user switched its mode): scan_enabled=true, `earnings_whole_market=true` (candidate pool = ALL US reporters today+prior day via NASDAQ public calendar `fetch_earnings_reporters`, ≥$2B cap floor via `earnings_min_market_cap_b`, top-60 by cap; watchlist fallback if calendar down), 100-ticker validated-universe watchlist, position size 10%, scan_max_candidates 10. ⚠ Two launch-blocking bugs found+fixed 2026-07-17: (1) scheduler had been silently dead since 7/15 (hung VIX/clock fetch, no timeout, 5-min scan windows — see scheduler.py hardening: 15s timeouts, 9:35–11:30 + 13:00–15:00 ET catch-up windows, Redis `sched:ran:{date}:{label}` dedupe, heartbeat logs 2×/hr); (2) the earnings-blackout circuit breaker vetoed every PEAD order at `_place_order_if_approved` (report date == today reads as "earnings within N days") — engine `earnings-pead` is now exempt from `check_ticker_blocked`. Both cost the live UNH 7/16 entry (+29.8% surprise, +7.4% gap).

**⚠ Intraday round 1 (2026-07-14, `docs/research/intraday-walkforward-2026-07-14.md`): NO robust $200/day edge.** 378 policies, 60d of 5m bars (yfinance — only window available; local .env Alpaca keys stale/401 at the time). Top test performer +$106/day went **−$133/day on the burned one-shot holdout**; negative overfit gaps everywhere = period luck. Engine defaults = most-robust-looking profile (mom20 stop1.5atr rr2 holdEOD) at 0.5% risk + 0.5% daily halt — a forward experiment, NOT an income claim.

**Intraday round 2 (2026-07-16, `docs/research/intraday-walkforward-round2-2026-07-16.md`): confirms round 1, more conclusively.** Local Alpaca keys turned out to work fine (round-1 "stale" note was outdated) — 2 years of real Alpaca 5m bars, 1,134 policies, 6 folds. The single most robust candidate found (only all-folds-positive policy) tested +$57.91/day → **−$275.50/day on holdout, −$13,778 max drawdown (−13.8% equity)** — worse than round 1, from a bigger/better search. This isn't a data-quantity problem anymore: the deterministic 5m rule family (ORB/VWAP-reversion/momentum) has no exploitable edge. Live engine still runs round-1 defaults (different policy, untouched by this finding) at conservative risk — user's explicit call to leave it running as a small bounded experiment rather than pause it.

**Bracket TIF fix (2026-07-14)**: `submit_bracket_order` now defaults **gtc** — day-TIF legs expired at the entry day's close and left overnight swing positions naked at the broker (bit both arms 7/13–7/14; position_monitor 60s loop was the only protection). Intraday engine passes `time_in_force="day"` explicitly (correct there). Positions opened BEFORE this fix still have no broker-side stops until re-entered.

**Intraday pnl/halt fix (2026-07-15)**: bracket-leg exits were reconciled with `pnl=None` (Trade History/track-record showed "—", and the daily loss halt summed real losses as $0 — it could never fire before the 6-trades/day cap did). Fixed: reads the filled child leg off the parent bracket order for the true exit price, tags `stop_loss`/`take_profit`; halt also takes `min(db_pnl, equity−last_equity)` as a broker-truth backstop.

**Earnings PEAD research (2026-07-16, `docs/research/earnings-drift-walkforward-2026-07-16.md` + round-2/expanded-universe JSON)**: a genuinely different information source than the price-pattern families above — long-only entry into large positive EPS surprises, held for days. First candidate across three tournaments to survive every out-of-sample check: 5-fold walk-forward (all 5 folds individually positive), an 18-month one-shot holdout (Sharpe 1.9), AND a same-day out-of-universe validation on 46 never-fitted tickers (still positive, roughly half the effect size — real signal, not pure noise, but partly universe-specific). Refit on a combined 105-ticker universe tightened the overfit gap to near-zero (−0.04) and validated clean against a FOURTH, completely unrelated 63-ticker universe (banks/REITs/energy/materials/biotech/utilities). Effect size stays modest everywhere (Sharpe 0.4–1.9) — not a fast path to $200/day, but the first real (if small) signal found. Research→build discipline: `research/earnings.py`'s `run_tournament(tickers=...)` param lets a refit target any universe without touching the shared `research/data.py::UNIVERSE` other tournaments depend on.

**The research → deploy → race loop** (the current operating model):
1. **Research**: walk-forward policy tournament over the deterministic rule family (`app/research/`, Admin page → Research, or `docker exec tap_backend python -m app.research.run`). Time-ordered train/test folds, one-shot holdout, leaderboard by out-of-sample Sharpe. Reports land in `docs/research/`.
2. **Deploy**: the winning policy's parameters become the live quant account's settings.
3. **Forward race**: agents account vs quant-winner account, compared in Admin → Strategy Lab. LLM strategies can NOT be backtested (model training data contains historical outcomes = lookahead by construction) — agents are judged forward-only against the tournament winner.
4. Repeat as data accrues. Never re-run the holdout on more than the single winner.

**Round-1 tournament results (2026-07-12**, `docs/research/walkforward-2026-07-12.json`): 650 policies, 7 folds, 2013–2026. Live baseline ranked **492/650**. Winning plateau: wide stops (3×ATR), 3:1 R:R, regime gate OFF, trend+meanrev blend — near-zero overfit gap across ranks 1-6 (robust plateau, not a spike). Holdout (one shot): +1.96%, maxDD −3.5%, vs SPY +22.4% — capital-preserving, not alpha; exposure capped ~40% (8×5%). Regime slice: mean reversion wins in SIDEWAYS, trend entries lost in late BULL.

**Forward race is LIVE (2026-07-13)**: two prod accounts — **Yash** (agents engine, admin, fresh Alpaca `PA3D6AOC1NYN` reset) and **Quant** (quanttest@example.com, quant engine, Alpaca `PA37ZVR2KZ0T`). Both have scan_enabled=true (scheduler: market open + midday). Quant's first trade: 22 AAPL @ 316.45, stop −5.56%/target +11.12%. Yash's first decisions: disciplined HOLDs. Old Yash Alpaca losses were dev-era junk — the account was reset; prod platform never traded it before 7/13.

**LLM ops findings (2026-07-13, all fixed — do not regress)**: DeepSeek **flash produces empty skeleton debates** on the senior prompts (rounds=[], NEUTRAL 0.5) — senior_model default is now **deepseek-v4-pro everywhere** (agents.py RunRequest/ScanRequest, scanner run_market_scan — was claude-opus-4-6 which would 404, NIM has no Anthropic routing). Runner hardening in `_nim_structured`: 2s global call pacing (free-tier RPM), 429s honor Retry-After (15/30/45s), transient 5xx retries, max_tokens 4096, prose-JSON fallback picks best schema-overlap object (≥3 fields), empty-thesis debates raise instead of flowing through as fake NEUTRAL HOLDs. NIM free tier also has a deeper quota — heavy scan days can exhaust it (429s that outlast backoff); scan_max_candidates on Yash set to 5.

**Round 2 DONE (2026-07-13**, `docs/research/walkforward-round2-2026-07-13.md`): 386 policies sweeping exits + portfolio construction. **Round-1 winner defended** (test Sharpe 0.82, overfit gap 0.00). Trailing stops hurt (cut the right tail), time exits trade Sharpe for win rate, **sizing is leverage not alpha** (identical Sharpe at 5/8/10%). **Quant policy params are now settings-driven** (`quant_*` keys in DEFAULTS/NUMERIC_BOUNDS, loaded per-user in `quant_baseline._load_params`, echoed in reasoning_json.params, visible in Strategy Lab STRATEGY_KEYS) — tournament winners deploy via settings, no code change. Research data layer prefers **Alpaca /v2/stocks/bars** (falls back to yfinance for ^VIX / when keys invalid — local .env Alpaca keys are stale/401, prod keys work). ⚠ research reports land in container /tmp — docker cp them out BEFORE rebuilding.

**Winner profile DEPLOYED to prod Quant account (2026-07-13 night)**: trend 40-65, require_macd=false, 3×ATR stops, rr 3, regime_gate=false — verified via settings API. From the next scheduled scan the Quant arm trades the tournament-validated policy. Existing AAPL position (opened under old params) keeps its original bracket.

**RELIABILITY & TRUST BACKLOG** (user: "one mistake and we're doomed" — correct; ordered by blast radius):
1. **DB backups** — nightly Neon `pg_dump` (GitHub Action → private artifact). The track record + user data ARE the company; currently one provider incident from gone.
2. **Error alerting** — Sentry free tier, backend + frontend. Right now production errors are only visible if someone reads Render logs.
3. **Operator kill switch** — platform-level `trading_halted` flag (admin endpoint + banner) checked by scheduler/scans/order placement. Circuit breakers exist per-strategy; this is the human big-red-button for "something looks wrong, stop everything now".
4. **Order seatbelts** — final pre-submit assertions independent of strategy logic: max orders/account/day, max notional per order vs equity, reject duplicate order for same run_id. Cheap, catches the "bug places 500 orders" class of doom.
5. **Deploy discipline** — no deploys during market hours (9:30–16:00 ET) once real users trade; today's mid-market deploy train was acceptable only because arms were brand new.
6. **Post-deploy smoke test** — GitHub Action after Render deploy: /health, login, one authed GET. Catches broken deploys before users do.
7. **Track-record methodology page** — public page explaining exactly how win rate/returns are computed from immutable trade rows. Pre-empts the "your numbers are fake" attack, which is the actual reputational kill shot in this space.
8. **Incident notes in repo** — especially: rotating SECRET_KEY invalidates ALL stored broker credentials (Fernet key derivation) → every user must re-paste Alpaca keys. Document before it's discovered at 2am.

**UI REDESIGN — DONE & DEPLOYED (2026-07-14, 13 commits pushed → Vercel)**: Phase 0 foundation (`src/lib/motion.ts` tokens — ONE ease [0.16,1,0.3,1], DUR.fast/base; `<Skeleton>`/`<SkeletonText>`, `<EmptyState>`, `<CountUp>`, `<PageTransition>`; `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` + CSS reduced-motion kill; price flash unified to 300ms `.flash-up/.flash-down`). Landing (stats skeleton), Dashboard (full-page skeleton, KPI count-ups), Agent Hub (typing indicator, animated confidence bar, auto-scroll debate, mobile col-span fix), Scanner (live per-candidate pipeline panel from existing WS events), tables (sticky header via own scroll container — max-h + overflow, NOT the Shell sticky trap; right-aligned mono numerics; skeletons; EmptyStates), Strategy Lab/Research (rank badges, holdout chips instead of JSON.stringify), **Settings Quant Policy Profile (8 quant_* sliders/toggles + one-click "Deploy tournament winner" preset — verified writes all 8 user_settings rows)**, header 1280px fix (QQQ + OPEN chip yield below xl), auth error shake, real favicon (frontend/public/favicon.svg — index.html referenced it but the file never existed). Post-deploy fix: SliderField value labels overflowed cards at ~1250px (fixed w-36 + nowrap → natural width + flex-wrap row). Recharts tooltips were already themed (brief item stale). rejection_reason is NOT rendered anywhere in the frontend — the truncation item is backend-only cleanup. New-page conventions: use motion.ts tokens + Skeleton + EmptyState, never a bare spinner page. Local browser-verification kit: test user uitest@example.com / UiTest!12345 (user_id 12, local Docker DB only); Chrome resize_window no-ops on a maximized window — render a fixed same-origin iframe at the target width instead to exercise breakpoints.

**NEXT UP**: decide whether to enable `strategy_mode="earnings"` on a real paper account (built + verified 2026-07-16, not yet turned on anywhere) — likely a fresh dedicated account for a clean forward track record, same pattern as the intraday/quant race accounts. Options as a forward-only arm (no free historical chains; minute-scale options scalping vetoed — unrealistic paper fills). Parallel low-effort: SMTP env vars, Neon pg_dump backups (reliability #1), Sentry (#2), weekly tournament cron, strip model chain-of-thought from risk rejection_reason (backend).

## Multi-Tenancy (★ read this first)

- **Auth**: every endpoint except `/auth/*` and `/ws` requires JWT (`require_user` dependency added at router level in `api/router.py`).
- **Broker**: users paste their Alpaca paper keys in Settings → verified live against Alpaca → Fernet-encrypted (key derived from `SECRET_KEY` in `core/crypto.py`) → stored in `broker_connections`. Rotating `SECRET_KEY` invalidates stored creds.
- **Per-user client**: `app/broker/credentials.py` — `get_client_for_user(user_id)` (120s TTL cache), FastAPI deps `optional_broker` (None → endpoints return empties) and `required_broker` (409 `broker_not_connected`).
- **AlpacaClient class**: `app/broker/alpaca_client.py` — instance-scoped creds. Module-level functions = legacy env-key path (market clock, price feed, circuit breakers, overnight agent, dev fallback).
- **Data isolation**: `user_id` column (nullable = legacy rows) on trades, agent_runs, equity_snapshots, notifications, activity_logs. All API queries filter by it. Added via idempotent `ALTER TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS` in `core/postgres.py::init_db` (no Alembic needed).
- **Per-user settings**: `user_settings` table; `get_user_setting(user_id, key, default)` falls back to platform_settings. Watchlist is per-user (`custom_watchlist` key).
- **Workers**: trade_sync groups trades by user; position_monitor / equity_tracker / intraday monitor loop `connected_user_ids()` + legacy env account; scheduled scans run **only for users with explicit `scan_enabled=true` user setting** (LLM cost control).
- **Order flow**: `run_structured_agent_analysis(..., user_id)` → `_place_order_if_approved` uses the user's client; no broker connected → emits `order_skipped` WS event, analysis-only.
- **Verified 2026-07-02**: two-user isolation test passed (401 unauth, cross-user trade fetch 404, watchlist isolation, fake Alpaca keys rejected with 400).

## Real-User Readiness (added 2026-07-03)

- **Rate limiting**: `core/rate_limit.py` — Redis sliding window, fails OPEN if Redis is down.
  login 10/15min per IP + 5/15min per email; signup 5/hr per IP; forgot-password 3/hr per email + 10/hr per IP; resend-verify 3/hr per user.
- **Password reset**: `POST /auth/forgot-password` (never reveals if email exists) → token in Redis (`pwreset:{sha256}`, 30min TTL) → `POST /auth/reset-password`. Reset revokes ALL sessions.
- **Email verification (soft)**: signup sends verify link (`verify:{sha256}` in Redis, 48h). `users.email_verified` — banner in Shell until verified, never blocks usage.
- **Mailer**: `core/mailer.py` — SMTP via env (`SMTP_HOST` etc.); unset host = link logged at WARNING (dev mode). Links use `FRONTEND_URL` (fallback localhost:5173).
- **Session revocation**: JWTs carry `iat`; `users.password_changed_at` (stored with microsecond=0 — iat is second-granularity) rejects older tokens in `get_current_user`. `POST /auth/change-password` returns a fresh token. Legacy tokens without iat die on first password change.
- **Admin**: `users.is_admin` — bootstrap via `ADMIN_EMAIL` env (auto-promoted on signup/login). `api/v1/admin.py`: users list, toggle-active (guards: not self, not other admins), invite CRUD, stats. `require_admin` dep in `core/auth.py`.
- **DB invite codes**: `invite_codes` table — max_uses/used_count/expires_at/revoked; signup accepts env `SIGNUP_INVITE_CODE` (master gate) OR a usable DB code. Invite links: `/?invite=CODE` pre-fills signup. Env code unset = open signup (DB codes then optional).
- **Frontend**: `pages/Auth/` (ForgotPassword, ResetPassword, VerifyEmail share AuthCard), `pages/Admin/`, Settings → Account Security (change password), `VerifyEmailBanner` in Shell (refreshes `/auth/me` → updates cached user incl. is_admin). Unauthed URL handling in App.tsx maps `/reset-password` + `/verify-email` + `/?invite=` to views (auth pages live outside the router).
- **Verified 2026-07-03**: full e2e via curl — signup→verify link logged→verify (reuse rejected), forgot→reset→old token 401→old password 401, change-password revokes prior tokens (same-second tokens survive by design), invite create→consume→reuse 403→bogus 403→revoke, disabled user login 403, self-disable 400, login rate limit tripped at 6th attempt, forgot-password 429 at 4th.

## Launch Prep (added 2026-07-03, same night)

- **Free-tier deploy** ($0/mo): Vercel (frontend) + Render free web service (backend) + Neon (Postgres) + Upstash (Redis) + UptimeRobot keep-awake. Full walkthrough in **DEPLOY.md**; `render.yaml` blueprint + `frontend/vercel.json` (SPA rewrites) committed.
  - `RUN_ALL_WORKERS=true` → trade_sync + equity_tracker run inside the API process (Render free has no worker services). NEVER set while the worker container also runs.
  - `PRICE_FEED_ENABLED=false` on free deploys — the tick stream's per-tick Redis SET would burn Upstash's 500K/mo quota.
  - Backend Dockerfile now has a CMD honoring `$PORT` (compose overrides it).
  - Production guard: `ENVIRONMENT=production` + default SECRET_KEY → refuses to start.
- **Product analytics**: `analytics_events` table + `core/analytics.py::track()` (fire-and-forget, never raises). Events: signup, login, broker_connected, agent_run, scan_run, manual_order — keep this list in the module docstring current. `GET /admin/analytics` → daily series (zero-filled), 7d event mix, funnel (from source-of-truth tables so pre-analytics users count), WAU. Charts on Admin page.
- **Landing page** (`pages/Landing/`): renders at `/` for logged-out visitors (App.tsx `initialUnauthedView`; deep links still go to login, `?invite=` to signup). Animated hero, cycling 7-agent pipeline, typewriter debate terminal, live stats from the public track-record endpoint, framework marquee (`animate-marquee` keyframes in tailwind.config), features/steps/CTA/disclaimer footer. Login/Signup logos link back to `/`.
- **Public AI track record**: `GET /api/v1/track-record/` — UNAUTHENTICATED by design (the shareable proof page). Anonymized aggregates only: decision mix, win rate on closed AI trades (agent_run_id set), monthly series, recent 20 calls (ticker/decision/confidence, no user data). Redis-cached 5 min. Frontend `/track-record` renders standalone (public, with signup CTA) when logged out and inside the Shell when logged in; sidebar under Intelligence.

## Post-Launch (added 2026-07-04)

- **Strategy Lab** (`GET /admin/strategy-lab`, section on Admin page): compares all broker-connected accounts side by side — equity curve as **% change from each account's first snapshot in range** (downsampled to ~200 pts), trade stats, agent run count, and the strategy-relevant per-user settings (`STRATEGY_KEYS` in `admin.py`: confidence gate, sizing, stops, scan flags, watchlist). Built for running multiple paper accounts with different strategy profiles to see which policies actually work. Overlaid % curves + comparison table in `pages/Admin/index.tsx`.
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Sidebar becomes a drawer below `lg` (hamburger in Header, overlay in Shell); Header/StatusBar condense on small screens. Page grids (Dashboard, AgentHub, Portfolio, Scanner, Alerts, Backtesting) stack below `lg` instead of crushing columns — keep new pages following this pattern.
- **Chart timezones**: `CandlestickChart.tsx` formats bar times in the viewer's local timezone (was rendering exchange/UTC times).
- **Quant Baseline engine** (added 2026-07-12): `app/agents/quant_baseline.py` — deterministic, zero-LLM control strategy (trend-follow + mean-reversion entries, MA200-break/RSI≥78 exits, 2×ATR stops, 2:1 R:R, regime-gated). Selected per user via `strategy_mode` setting (`"agents"` | `"quant"`, in `DEFAULTS`) or explicit `strategy` in `POST /agents/run`; scheduled scans respect it (`scanner.py`). Same lifecycle as the agent pipeline (AgentRun row, `run:{id}` WS events, `_place_order_if_approved`), tagged `llm_model="quant-baseline"` so Strategy Lab (Engine column) compares apples-to-apples. Purpose: if agents can't beat these rules, the product story is explainability, not alpha. Settings → AI Model has the engine dropdown.
- **MACD signal-line fix** (2026-07-12): `structured_runner._fetch_market_data`, `scanner.py`, `backtest.py` computed the signal line as EMA9 of *price* instead of EMA9 of the MACD series — `macd_bullish` was effectively always false (agents got bad data; quant trend rule could never fire). All three now match the correct implementations in `market.py`/`agents.py`. `overnight_agent.py` intentionally uses `ema12 > ema26` (MACD>0), left as-is.

## Security Hardening (added 2026-07-12)

- **Platform LLM keys are admin-only**: `POST /settings/` rejects `PLATFORM_KEY_ENV_MAP` keys (anthropic/nvidia) with 403 for non-admins — previously ANY user could overwrite them + os.environ. Reads were already blocked.
- **Server-side setting bounds**: `NUMERIC_BOUNDS` + `ENUM_VALUES` in `api/v1/settings.py` clamp cost/risk settings at write (debate_rounds ≤3, scan_max_candidates ≤10, confidence 0-1, etc.); `strategy_mode` must be agents|quant. Scanner also hard-caps `max_candidates` to 10 at read. Add new cost-sensitive settings to NUMERIC_BOUNDS.
- **Per-user quotas on LLM endpoints** (sliding 1h, Redis, fails open): `/agents/run` 30/hr, `/agents/scan` 6/hr, `/agents/options/analyze` 30/hr. Constants at top of `agents.py`. Ticker inputs validated against `TICKER_PATTERN`; ScanRequest max_candidates ≤10, watchlist ≤60.
- **WS run-room ownership**: `/ws/runs/{run_id}` closes 4403 unless the token's user owns the run (legacy NULL-user runs stay open). `_authenticate_ws` now returns the user id.
- **CORS**: production allows ONLY `FRONTEND_URL` — the `*.vercel.app` wildcard regex is dev-only unless `CORS_ALLOW_VERCEL_PREVIEWS=true` (it admits any Vercel-hosted site). Dead literal `"https://*.vercel.app"` removed.
- **API docs disabled in production** (`/docs`, `/redoc`, `/openapi.json` → 404 when `ENVIRONMENT=production`).
- **Security headers**: backend middleware (nosniff, X-Frame-Options DENY, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, HSTS in prod, `Cache-Control: no-store` on /api). `vercel.json` adds the same + enforced CSP subset (frame-ancestors/object-src/base-uri) + full CSP in **Report-Only** — check browser console for violations, then promote it to enforced.
- Verified 2026-07-12 via curl/websockets: non-admin platform-key write 403, clamps applied, 422 on out-of-range run/scan params + bad tickers, WS attacker/no-token rejected + owner connects, 31st run in an hour → 429, `npm audit --omit=dev` clean.
- **Refresh-token auth** (same day, second pass): access JWTs now live **30 min**; sessions persist via rotating refresh tokens — `db/models/refresh_token.py` (SHA-256 stored, `family_id`, single-use rotation, **replay of a rotated token revokes the whole family**), `POST /auth/refresh`, real `POST /auth/logout` (revokes family), password change/reset revokes all user refresh tokens. Frontend: `tap_refresh` in localStorage, axios 401 interceptor does single-flight refresh + one retry (`api.ts`), `saveAuth(token, user, refresh)`. Legacy 30-day JWTs stay valid until they expire. Table auto-created by `init_db` create_all (import registered in main.py). Verified: rotation, replay→family-kill, logout, pw-change revocation, browser test (corrupt access token + valid refresh → dashboard self-heals, parallel queries share one refresh).
- **Model allowlist**: `ALLOWED_LLM_MODELS` in `db/models/settings.py` — enforced on `/agents/run`, `/agents/scan` (Pydantic validator) and the `llm_model` setting (ENUM_VALUES). Add new models THERE when the Settings dropdown grows.
- **Tracebacks** no longer stored in `agent_runs.error` (message only; full trace goes to server logs) — structured_runner, quant_baseline, legacy runner.
- **CSP enforced** on Vercel (was Report-Only): `script-src 'self'`, fonts from Google, `connect-src` **pinned to the Render backend URL** — vercel.json must be updated if the backend moves. Bundle statically verified: no inline scripts / eval / workers; tradingview+alpaca strings are plain `<a href>` links.

## Research Engine (added 2026-07-12)

- **Purpose**: the user's "hundreds of accounts" experiment idea, done right — instead of hundreds of real Alpaca accounts, a **walk-forward policy tournament** over the deterministic quant rule family (`app/research/`). Train/test split by TIME (never shuffled), rolling folds, final N-month **holdout that only the tournament winner ever touches, once**.
- `research/data.py` — daily OHLCV via yfinance (pickle cache in /tmp/research_cache), ~60-ticker universe (survivorship-biased — rankings meaningful, absolute returns optimistic), vectorized historical regime series (port of regime_detector scoring, rolling windows only).
- `research/engine.py` — `Policy` dataclass (defaults = live quant baseline; grid varies RSI bands, MACD requirement, stops/RR, regime gate, setup ablations), matrix `Panel`, honest simulator: signal on close t → fill at open t+1, stops/TP intraday with stop-first assumption, 5bps slippage.
- `research/walkforward.py` — fold machinery, MIN_TRADES filter, leaderboard ranked by mean TEST Sharpe across folds (must qualify in EVERY fold — the "universally applicable" bar), overfit gap (train−test), regime/setup-sliced metrics, SPY benchmark, one-shot holdout.
- Run: `docker exec tap_backend python -m app.research.run [--quick]` (writes /tmp/research_report.json) or `POST /admin/research/run` + `GET /admin/research/latest` (report cached in Redis `research:report`).
- **★ LLM strategies can NOT be backtested** — the models' training data contains the historical outcomes (lookahead by construction). The tournament covers deterministic policies only; agents are evaluated forward against the tournament winner as baseline.

## Agent Contracts (★ Key Feature)

**File:** `backend/app/agents/contracts.py`

Each agent has a strict Pydantic output schema. Claude is forced to respond
using `tool_use` with the exact schema — no free-form text parsing between agents.

| Contract | Fields |
|---|---|
| `TechnicalReport` | rsi_14, macd_crossover, support/resistance, trend, signal, confidence |
| `SentimentReport` | sentiment_score, institutional_flow, put_call_ratio, short_interest |
| `NewsReport` | headline_sentiment, material_news, catalyst_upcoming, risk_events |
| `FundamentalReport` | pe_ratio, forward_pe, revenue_growth_yoy, gross_margin, vs_sector_pe |
| `AnalystBundle` | Aggregates all 4 above + helper methods (bullish_count, avg_confidence) |
| `ResearcherDebate` | rounds[], bull/bear thesis, debate_winner, key_risks/catalysts |
| `RiskAssessment` | approved, risk_level, position_pct, stop_loss_pct, rejection_reason |
| `FinalDecision` | decision (BUY/HOLD/SELL), position_size_pct, order_type, stop_loss_pct |

---

## World-Class Frameworks (baked into agent prompts)

| Framework | Agent | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Wyckoff Method | Technical | Accumulation/distribution phases, springs, upthrusts, composite man |
| ICT Concepts | Technical | Fair Value Gaps, Order Blocks, Liquidity Sweeps, Market Structure Shifts |
| Turtle Trader Rules | Technical | 20-day breakouts, ATR stops (2×ATR14), pyramid into winners |
| Smart Money Concepts | Technical | Premium/discount zones, stop hunts, institutional hiding spots |
| Options Flow Analysis | Sentiment | PCR interpretation, UOA (unusual options activity), IV crush |
| Institutional Flow | Sentiment | 13F direction analysis, dumb vs smart money distinction |
| CANSLIM | Fundamental | C/A/N/S/L/I/M — framework behind biggest historical stock winners |
| PEAD Strategy | Fundamental | Post-earnings drift — systematic underreaction to earnings beats |
| AQR Quality Factor | Fundamental | Margin stability, ROE consistency, operating leverage |
| Kelly Criterion | Risk Manager | Half-Kelly position sizing: f* = (p×b - q)/b, capped at 5% |
| ATR-based Stops | Risk Manager | Dynamic stops = 2×ATR(14) — adapts to current volatility |
| Portfolio VaR | Risk Manager | 25% sector cap, 20% cash reserve, 5% daily drawdown circuit breaker |
| Position Pyramid | Portfolio Mgr | Initial 50%, add 25% at 1×ATR, add 25% at 2×ATR in-favor |
| 3-Target Exit | Portfolio Mgr | T1 at 1.5:1 R:R (33% off), T2 at 2.5:1 (50% off), T3 trailing |

## Market Regime Detector

**File:** `backend/app/workers/regime_detector.py`

Classifies market into 4 regimes using SPY + VIX data. 15-minute cache shared between scanner and API.

| Regime | Trigger | Strategy | Max Position |
|---|---|---|---|
| BULL_TRENDING | SPY > MA50 > MA200, RSI 50-70, VIX < 20 | Momentum, buy breakouts | 5% |
| BEAR_TRENDING | SPY < MA50 < MA200 | Reduce exposure, tight stops | 2% |
| HIGH_VOLATILITY | VIX > 28 | Cash, highest conviction only | 1.5% |
| SIDEWAYS | Mixed signals | Mean reversion, buy oversold | 3% |

API: `GET /api/v1/market/regime`

---

## Scanner

**File:** `backend/app/workers/scanner.py`

Multi-factor pre-screen + full AI analysis on top candidates.

Factors scored: RSI, MACD, price vs MA50/MA200, volume ratio, ATR-14, Bollinger Bands width,
Stochastic %K, ROC-10, volume trend, mean reversion setup, 52-week high proximity, PEAD signal.

Custom criteria via `ScanCriteria` (in `agents.py` POST body):
- `rsi_min`, `rsi_max`, `vol_ratio_min`, `min_score`, `direction`
- `require_above_ma50`, `require_above_ma200`, `require_macd_bullish`

Circuit breakers: VIX gate (>30 suppresses BUYs), daily drawdown halt (-5%), earnings blackout.

---

## Known Issues / Watch Out (multi-tenant additions)

- market.py / backtest.py / price_feed use platform env Alpaca keys for market DATA (fine — data is not account-scoped)
- ALL FIXED 2026-07-02: export-csv shadowing, WS auth (JWT via ?token=, frontend `wsUrl()`),
  worker double-run (worker container = trade_sync + equity_tracker ONLY; backend lifespan
  = position_monitor, scheduler, overnight, price_feed — never start a loop in both),
  per-user circuit breakers, legacy env account deduped via `legacy_env_client()`
- Settings keys are 1:1 frontend↔backend now (scan_enabled, long_only,
  min_confidence_to_trade, intraday_monitor_enabled, overnight_agent_enabled,
  scan_max_candidates, max_position_pct, daily_loss_limit_pct) — keep them in sync
- long_only=false → SELL signals liquidate existing longs only; naked shorts are never placed

## Known Issues / Watch Out

- Docker frontend on Windows does NOT hot-reload: bind-mount file events don't reach
  Vite in the container. After frontend changes, `docker compose restart frontend`
  (and hard-refresh the browser). To preview logged-out pages with a logged-in browser,
  open http://127.0.0.1:5173 — different origin, no stored token (CORS-allowed in main.py).
- `structured_runner.py` uses `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` for WS emit from thread executor
- `tool_choice="required"` used for NIM — do NOT change to named function format
- Alembic not auto-run on startup — run `docker exec tap_backend alembic upgrade head` after schema changes
- Recharts bundle is large (573KB) — already split via Vite manualChunks
- bcrypt: NEVER use passlib `pwd_context` — use `import bcrypt; bcrypt.hashpw/checkpw` directly (see core/auth.py)
- Trade sync: new trades save as `"submitted"` status; sync worker polls all pre-fill statuses (pending_new, new, accepted, submitted, partial) every 2 min

## Agent Discipline Rules (hardcoded — do not soften)

| Rule | Value | Enforced? |
|---|---|---|
| Min confidence to signal | 0.60 | Yes |
| Min confidence for trade | 0.70 | Yes |
| Min consensus for BUY/SELL | 3 of 4 analysts | Yes |
| Max position size | 5% portfolio | Yes |
| Mandatory stop-loss | 7% default (or 2×ATR if data available) | Yes |
| Min Risk/Reward ratio | 2:1 | Yes |
| VIX gate | VIX > 30 → suppress BUY signals | Yes |
| Daily drawdown halt | -5% portfolio → pause all scans | Yes |
| Earnings blackout | Within 3 days of earnings → block trade | Yes |

**Philosophy:** "Consistency over home runs. 1% per day compounded = 1,000% per year. Preserve capital first, profits second."
